# Architecture

## Overview

GitOdrile uses a web frontend inside a Tauri desktop shell, with Rust responsible for filesystem access, process execution, Git operations, platform integration, and security-sensitive behavior.

```text
React UI
  -> typed frontend service layer
    -> Tauri commands
      -> Rust application services
        -> Git process adapter / filesystem / OS integration
```

## Architectural objectives

- Keep UI state independent from raw Git command output.
- Make Git operations testable without rendering the UI.
- Keep system Git replaceable behind a stable domain boundary.
- Model operations around intent and consequences.
- Make platform differences explicit.
- Prevent arbitrary shell execution from the frontend.

## Proposed Rust modules

```text
src-tauri/src/
  app/
  git/
    command_runner.rs
    repository.rs
    status.rs
    diff.rs
    history.rs
    branches.rs
    remotes.rs
  operations/
    save_version.rs
    publish.rs
    update.rs
    restore.rs
  recovery/
  credentials/
  platform/
  errors.rs
```

The current scaffold is smaller. Introduce modules as real behavior appears; do not create empty abstractions solely to match this diagram.

## Operation planning

User actions should first produce an operation plan.

```ts
type OperationPlan = {
  kind: "read" | "local-mutation" | "history-mutation" | "remote-mutation";
  summary: string;
  steps: OperationStep[];
  risks: Risk[];
  recovery?: RecoveryPlan;
  requiresConfirmation: boolean;
};
```

The frontend may render a friendly explanation from this structure. Rust remains responsible for validating the repository state immediately before execution.

## Git command runner

The initial adapter should:

- receive a repository path and an argument list;
- invoke `git` without a shell;
- set the working directory explicitly;
- capture stdout, stderr, and exit code;
- support cancellation and timeouts where appropriate;
- redact credentials and secrets from logs;
- return typed errors;
- record diagnostics at a safe verbosity level.

Prefer stable machine-readable formats such as porcelain output. Parsing must have fixtures covering Git versions and edge cases.

## Repository identity

Do not assume the selected folder is the repository root. Resolve and retain:

- worktree root;
- Git directory;
- common Git directory for worktrees;
- bare/non-bare state;
- current branch or detached state;
- remotes;
- case-sensitivity and filesystem capabilities where relevant.

## State management

Keep persistent application preferences separate from repository-derived state.

Candidate categories:

- application preferences;
- recent repositories;
- per-repository UI state;
- live repository snapshot;
- in-progress operation state;
- diagnostics.

Avoid making Git state writable from arbitrary frontend components.

## Security model

- Minimize Tauri capabilities.
- Validate and canonicalize paths in Rust.
- Do not expose a generic “run command” Tauri endpoint.
- Do not interpolate user data into shell commands.
- Treat repository content, hooks, config, and remote responses as untrusted.
- Never log tokens, credential helper output, private key material, or authenticated remote URLs.
- Require explicit consent before sending source or diffs to an AI service.

## Testing strategy

### Unit tests

- status parser;
- branch/ref parser;
- diff metadata parser;
- operation planner;
- plain-language state mapping;
- path validation.

### Integration tests

Create temporary repositories for:

- clean repository;
- staged and unstaged changes;
- untracked and ignored files;
- initial repository with no commits;
- ahead/behind/diverged branches;
- detached HEAD;
- merge conflict;
- worktree;
- line-ending-only changes;
- non-ASCII paths and commit messages.

### UI tests

Focus on critical workflows and state rendering rather than brittle visual snapshots.

## Platform notes

### Windows

- WebView2;
- path prefixes and drive letters;
- file locks;
- CRLF configuration;
- Git for Windows and credential manager behavior;
- optional WSL repositories require a separate design decision.

### macOS

- WKWebView;
- Keychain and code signing/notarization;
- case-insensitive filesystems are common;
- application sandbox implications if pursuing the Mac App Store.

### Linux

- WebKitGTK;
- Secret Service availability varies;
- Wayland/X11 and compositor differences;
- packaging and dependency differences;
- solid visual fallbacks for unsupported native effects.

## Future decisions requiring ADRs

- system Git versus embedded Git implementation;
- state management library;
- credential storage strategy;
- update mechanism;
- AI provider architecture;
- WSL repository support;
- telemetry policy;
- plugin/extension model.
