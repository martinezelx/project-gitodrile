# AGENTS.md

This file is the primary operating guide for AI coding agents working on GitOdrile.

## Mission

Build a cross-platform desktop Git client that makes version control understandable and safe for beginners, non-developers, students, AI-assisted builders, designers, and developers who prefer a calmer workflow.

GitOdrile must not merely map Git commands to buttons. It should translate user intent into safe Git operations.

Examples:

- “Save a version” may create a commit.
- “Publish changes” may push the current branch.
- “Get team changes” may fetch and integrate remote changes.
- “Try this separately” may create a branch.
- “Go back to this moment” may use revert, reset, checkout, or a recovery branch depending on context.

The UI should explain what will happen and preserve a recovery path whenever reasonably possible.

## Product positioning

Working name: **GitOdrile**

Working promise: **Git without the bite.**

Alternative description: **A friendly Git desktop client.**

The crocodile mascot should feel confident and friendly, not childish. Branding may use small moments of personality, but the product must remain credible for professional work.

## Target users

Primary:

- People who write or modify software without understanding Git deeply.
- AI-assisted builders using tools such as coding agents and app generators.
- Junior developers and students.
- Designers, writers, game developers, and other collaborators working inside repositories.

Secondary:

- Experienced developers who want a fast, focused desktop Git client.
- Small teams that value safe workflows and simple onboarding.

## Core product principles

1. **Use human language by default.**
   Do not lead with commit, rebase, detached HEAD, reflog, upstream, or fast-forward unless advanced mode is enabled or the term is necessary.

2. **Never hide consequences.**
   Simplify terminology, but clearly explain whether an action changes local files, history, a remote repository, or teammates' work.

3. **Safety before cleverness.**
   Before destructive or history-rewriting operations, create or offer a recovery point. Never run a destructive command merely because it produces a cleaner implementation.

4. **Progressive disclosure.**
   The default interface should be approachable. Advanced users must still be able to inspect exact branches, commits, remotes, and commands.

5. **Local-first and privacy-conscious.**
   Repository data stays local unless the user explicitly invokes a remote or cloud feature. AI features must be optional and transparent about transmitted data.

6. **Cross-platform behavior is part of correctness.**
   Handle paths, line endings, credentials, symlinks, filesystem casing, file locks, and process behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

7. **Performance matters, but UX matters more.**
   Rust and Tauri are implementation choices, not the customer-facing value proposition.

## Technical direction

### Frontend

- React + TypeScript + Vite.
- Functional components and hooks.
- Keep domain logic out of visual components.
- Prefer accessible primitives and semantic HTML.
- Use CSS variables as design tokens.
- Avoid a large UI framework until the interaction model stabilizes.

### Desktop shell

- Tauri 2.
- Use narrow commands between frontend and Rust.
- Validate all command inputs in Rust.
- Keep Tauri capabilities minimal and explicit.

### Git integration

Initial strategy:

- Use the system Git executable.
- Detect and report the installed Git version.
- Execute Git through a dedicated Rust service.
- Use machine-readable output where available.
- Set locale/environment explicitly where output parsing depends on it.
- Never construct shell strings from user input; pass arguments as separate process arguments.

Longer-term options may include `gitoxide`, `git2-rs`, or a hybrid implementation. Do not migrate away from system Git without an ADR explaining compatibility, credential, performance, and maintenance trade-offs.

### Architecture boundaries

Keep these concerns separated:

- `repository`: repository discovery and metadata.
- `status`: working tree and index state.
- `history`: commits, branches, tags, and timeline.
- `changes`: file changes and diffs.
- `sync`: remotes, fetch, pull/integration, and push.
- `recovery`: snapshots, safety branches, restore operations, and reflog-backed recovery.
- `conflicts`: conflict detection and resolution.
- `platform`: OS-specific behavior.
- `credentials`: authentication and secret storage integration.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## UX vocabulary

Default simple-mode wording:

| Git concept | Default user-facing wording |
| --- | --- |
| repository | project |
| commit | saved version |
| commit changes | save version |
| push | publish changes |
| fetch/pull | get team changes |
| branch | separate workspace / version line |
| checkout/switch | switch workspace |
| merge conflict | overlapping changes |
| clean working tree | everything is saved |
| ahead of remote | saved locally, not published |
| behind remote | newer team changes are available |
| stash | set changes aside |

This table is guidance, not a rigid translation layer. Use exact Git terminology in advanced views and educational explanations.

## Safety rules for Git operations

Agents must follow these rules when implementing operations:

- Classify each operation as read-only, local mutation, history mutation, remote mutation, or destructive.
- Provide a preview/plan for history-changing and remote-changing actions.
- Prefer reversible operations.
- Create a recovery reference before destructive changes when feasible.
- Never use `reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, force push, branch deletion, or equivalent behavior without explicit user confirmation and a recovery strategy.
- Do not silently resolve conflicts.
- Do not silently discard untracked files.
- Surface hooks and signing failures accurately; do not bypass them by default.
- Preserve user Git configuration unless a setting is explicitly scoped to GitOdrile.

## UI and visual direction

Read `DESIGN.md` before changing visual styles.

In summary:

- Modern desktop interface with rounded surfaces and restrained translucency.
- Dense information areas such as diffs must use solid, highly readable backgrounds.
- Support light and dark themes.
- Use motion sparingly and respect reduced-motion settings.
- Aim for professional friendliness, not cartoon-heavy gamification.

## Development conventions

- TypeScript strict mode must stay enabled.
- Rust code must pass `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
- Avoid `any` unless interacting with an untyped boundary and document why.
- Return structured errors from Rust; do not expose raw command output as the primary error message.
- Add unit tests for parsers and operation planners.
- Add integration tests around temporary Git repositories.
- Keep commits focused and use conventional commit prefixes where practical.
- Update documentation when behavior, architecture, or vocabulary changes.

## Agent workflow

Before coding:

1. Read `README.md`, this file, `DESIGN.md`, and relevant files under `docs/`.
2. Inspect the existing implementation before proposing architectural changes.
3. Identify platform-specific implications.
4. State assumptions in the PR or commit description.

While coding:

1. Make the smallest coherent change.
2. Preserve safety boundaries.
3. Add or update tests.
4. Check keyboard accessibility and empty/error/loading states.
5. Avoid introducing dependencies for trivial utilities.

Before finishing:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

If a command is not available yet, document that honestly rather than claiming it passed.

## Early priorities

1. Repository opening and validation.
2. A structured Rust Git command runner.
3. Status parsing with fixtures and tests.
4. The main application shell and repository overview.
5. Plain-language status summaries.
6. Safe save-version flow.
7. Fetch/publish flows.
8. Recovery model.
9. Conflict experience.

## Out of scope for the first MVP

- Interactive rebase.
- Submodule management.
- Full pull-request review suite.
- Built-in terminal.
- Enterprise administration.
- Custom Git hosting server.
- Complex multi-repository workspaces.
- Mandatory cloud accounts.
- Autonomous AI changes to repositories.

## Decision records

For significant architectural decisions, add an ADR under `docs/adr/` using:

- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Alternatives considered

Do not overwrite major decisions silently.
